Complete Project Scope: Multi-Tenant Tradie Business Management App
Executive Summary
A cross-platform mobile application for tradespeople to manage their business operations, designed to build a large user network with a free or cost-covering pricing model. The app features multi-tenancy, team management, job tracking, invoicing, two-way SMS communication, subcontractor payment tracking, and comprehensive Xero integration.
Target Market: Solo tradies and small trade businesses (1-10 employees) in Australia/New Zealand initially, expandable globally.
Business Model: Free or minimal subscription to cover infrastructure costs. SMS charged at cost (5¢ per 160 characters).
Core Value: Replace multiple apps and paperwork with one comprehensive tool accessible from mobile devices on-site.

Multi-Tenancy Architecture
Organization Structure
Organization (Business)
├── Owner (1) - Full control
├── Admins (0-n) - Nearly full control, no billing
├── Employees (0-n) - Limited permissions
└── Subcontractors (0-n) - View assigned jobs only
Data Isolation

All tables include organization_id foreign key
Row Level Security enforces data boundaries
Clerk Organizations manages membership
JWT tokens include organization context

SMS System Specifications
Pricing Structure
Cost: 5¢ per SMS (per 160 characters)
Credit Bundles:

100 SMS = $5.00 (5¢ each)
500 SMS = $25.00 (5¢ each)
1,000 SMS = $50.00 (5¢ each)
5,000 SMS = $250.00 (5¢ each)

Character Counting:

Standard SMS: 160 characters = 1 credit
161-320 characters = 2 credits
321-480 characters = 3 credits
And so on...

Two-Way SMS Architecture
Outbound SMS (App → Client):

User composes message in app
Choose sender:

Organization SMS number (default)
User's personal SMS number (if configured)


System checks SMS credits
Sends via Tall Bob API
Deducts credits
Creates conversation thread
Logs message in sms_messages

Inbound SMS (Client → App):

Client replies to SMS
Tall Bob webhook receives inbound message
System identifies conversation by phone number
Links to client record if exists
Notifies relevant user(s) via push notification
Message appears in conversation thread in app
User can reply directly from app

Conversation Threading:

Each unique phone number = one conversation
Messages displayed chronologically
Context preserved (which job/invoice triggered conversation)
Multiple users can view conversation
Only sender or org owner/admin can reply

Tall Bob Integration Points:
typescript// Send SMS from user's number
POST /api/sms/send
{
  from: user.sms_phone_number,
  to: client.phone,
  message: "Invoice #1234 sent...",
  context: {
    jobId: "uuid",
    invoiceId: "uuid"
  }
}

// Webhook for inbound messages
POST /api/webhooks/tallbob/inbound
{
  messageId: "tb_msg_123",
  from: "+61412345678",
  to: "+61487654321", // org or user number
  body: "Thanks, received!",
  receivedAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

// Webhook for delivery status
POST /api/webhooks/tallbob/status
{
  messageId: "tb_msg_123",
  status: "delivered",
  deliveredAt: "2025-01-15T10:29:45Z"
}
```

## Subcontractor Payment Tracking

### Tracking Components

**Labor (Time-based):**
- Subcontractor logs hours on assigned jobs
- Hourly rate captured from `organization_members.hourly_rate`
- Time logs require approval (Owner/Admin)
- Calculation: `hours × hourly_rate = labor_cost`
- Accumulates in `organization_members.owed_amount`

**Materials/Products:**
- Subcontractor adds materials used on job
- Captures: description, supplier, quantity, unit price
- Uploads receipt photo
- Requires approval (Owner/Admin)
- Can be marked as "purchased by subcontractor" → add to owed amount
- Or "purchased by company" → track as company expense

**Equipment Hire:**
- Subcontractor adds hired equipment to job
- Daily/weekly/monthly rate
- Start date, end date, total cost
- Receipt upload
- Requires approval
- Adds to owed amount if paid by subcontractor

### Payment Workflow

**Creating Payment Record:**
1. Owner/Admin navigates to subcontractor profile
2. Views "Amount Owed" (running total)
3. Clicks "Create Payment"
4. System auto-populates:
   - All approved, unpaid time logs
   - All approved, unpaid materials
   - All approved, unpaid equipment
5. Review and confirm breakdown
6. Record payment:
   - Payment date
   - Amount paid
   - Payment method (bank transfer, cash, check)
   - Reference number
7. Option to sync to Xero as Bill
8. Payment recorded → `owed_amount` updated

**Subcontractor View:**
- Dashboard shows: "Amount Owed to Me: $2,450"
- View breakdown:
  - Pending approval: $800 (awaiting approval)
  - Approved, unpaid: $1,250
  - Paid this month: $3,100
- Payment history
- Download payment statements

**Xero Sync:**
- Create Bill in Xero when payment processed
- Sync subcontractor as Supplier in Xero
- Line items: labor, materials, equipment
- Mark as paid in Xero when recorded in app

---

## Xero Integration Scope

### Four-Way Sync

**1. Contacts (Clients) ↔ Xero**
- **App → Xero:** Create/update clients as Contacts
- **Xero → App:** Import existing contacts (one-time or periodic)
- Mapping: client name, email, phone, address, ABN
- Conflict resolution: App is source of truth, Xero updated

**2. Invoices ↔ Xero**
- **App → Xero:** Create/update invoices automatically
- When invoice status = "sent" or "paid"
- Line items, GST, amounts, due dates all synced
- **Xero → App:** Payment status synced back
- If paid in Xero, mark as paid in app
- Two-way payment reconciliation

**3. Expenses ↔ Xero**
- **App → Xero:** Sync approved expenses as Bank Transactions or Expenses
- Categories mapped to Xero accounts
- Receipt images attached (if Xero API supports)
- **Xero → App:** (Optional) Import Xero expenses not in app

**4. Bills (Subcontractor Payments) → Xero**
- **App → Xero:** Create Bill when subcontractor paid
- Subcontractor = Supplier in Xero
- Line items detail labor + materials + equipment
- Mark as paid with payment date
- **Xero → App:** Read-only, no import needed

### OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Xero" in settings
2. Redirects to Xero OAuth consent
3. User selects Xero organization
4. Callback receives tokens
5. Store encrypted in `xero_connections`
6. Initial sync prompt: "Import existing contacts?"

### Sync Options
- **Auto-sync:** Real-time (on invoice send, payment record, etc.)
- **Manual sync:** "Sync Now" button
- **Scheduled sync:** Nightly for payment status updates
- **Conflict handling:** Log conflicts, manual resolution

### Sync Logs & Debugging
- Every sync action logged
- Success/failure status
- Error messages preserved
- Retry mechanism for failed syncs
- User-friendly error messages

---

## Approval Workflows

### Timesheet Approval

**Submission:**

Risk Mitigation
Technical Risks

Xero API changes: Monitor Xero developer updates, build abstraction layer
SMS delivery failures: Implement retry logic, status monitoring, alternative providers
Performance with large datasets: Pagination, lazy loading, database indexing
Multi-tenancy data leaks: Comprehensive RLS, automated tests, security audits

Business Risks

Low adoption: Focus on onboarding UX, user feedback, marketing
High SMS costs: Monitor usage patterns, optimize messaging, transparent pricing
Competitor features: Iterative development, user-requested features prioritized
Regulation changes (accounting/GST): Flexible schema, compliance monitoring

Operational Risks

Support burden: Comprehensive help docs, in-app guidance, community forum
Scaling issues: Serverless architecture scales automatically, monitor costs
Data loss: Daily backups, point-in-time recovery (Neon feature)

Questions for Clarification

Tall Bob API: Do you have the full API documentation ready to share? Need to understand:

Authentication method
Send SMS endpoint
Inbound webhook payload format
Delivery status webhook format
Number provisioning process


SMS Number Provisioning: How do organizations/users get their Tall Bob SMS numbers?

Automatic during signup?
Manual admin setup?
Cost involved?


Subscription Model: Even though free/low-cost, should we build infrastructure now?

Free tier limits (users, jobs, SMS)?
Paid tier pricing (if any)?
Stripe subscription setup?


Initial Target Market: Focus on specific trade (e.g., electricians) or all trades?

Affects terminology, templates, checklist defaults


MYOB/QuickBooks: Build after Xero is stable, or parallel development?
Beta Testing: Do you have existing contacts/tradespeople to beta test?
