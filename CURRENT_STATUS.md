# Tradie App - Current Status

## âœ… What's Working

### Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
- **Status**: Fully functional on your phone via Expo Go
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based auth system (bypasses Clerk React 19 incompatibility)
- **Screens**: All Phase 1 screens implemented:
  - Jobs list and detail
  - Calendar view
  - Clients list
  - Profile/More screen
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab navigation working
- **UI**: React Native Paper components styled and functional
- **Data**: Currently showing mock data (ready to connect to API)

### Backend API Endpoints
- **Created**: JWT authentication endpoints for mobile
  - `/api/mobile-auth/sign-in` - Sign in with email/password
  - `/api/mobile-auth/verify` - Verify JWT tokens
- **Status**: Code written, committed, pushed to GitHub
- **Integration**: Uses existing Clerk user data
- **Security**: JWT tokens with 30-day expiration

## âœ… Vercel Deployment - FIXED!

### The Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. **Root Directory** already set to `apps/web` in Vercel âœ“
2. **Excluded mobile app** from npm workspace (workspace only includes `apps/web`)
3. **Installed React 18 at root level** so Next.js can find it

### What Was The Problem?
- Root Directory setting wasn't enough on its own
- Next.js installed in root `node_modules` couldn't find React
- React was only in `apps/web/node_modules` due to workspace isolation
- Solution: Install React 18 explicitly at root level

### Deployment Status
- **Latest commit**: Fix Vercel build by installing React 18 at root level
- **Build tested locally**: âœ… Success
- **Pushed to GitHub**: âœ… Done
- **Vercel auto-deploying**: ðŸ”„ In progress

Once Vercel finishes deploying (check your dashboard), the backend API endpoints will be live!

## ðŸ“± After Vercel Deploys

Once the deployment succeeds, your mobile app will be able to:

1. **Authenticate** with production credentials
2. **Fetch real data** from production database
3. **View actual jobs** from your organization
4. **See real clients**
5. **Access calendar** with real appointments

No changes needed to the mobile app - it's already configured with:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://tradie-app-web.vercel.app/api
```

## ðŸ“‹ Next Development Tasks

After authentication is working, the next phase includes:

### Phase 2 Features (from MOBILE_PLAN.md):
- Job detail screens with full information
- Time tracking (start/stop timer)
- Material/equipment entry
- Photo capture and upload
- Job notes
- Status updates
