# Tradie App - Current Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
- **Status**: Fully functional on your phone via Expo Go
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based auth system (bypasses Clerk React 19 incompatibility)
- **Screens**: All Phase 1 screens implemented:
  - Jobs list and detail
  - Calendar view
  - Clients list
  - Profile/More screen
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab navigation working
- **UI**: React Native Paper components styled and functional
- **Data**: Currently showing mock data (ready to connect to API)

### Backend API Endpoints
- **Created**: JWT authentication endpoints for mobile
  - `/api/mobile-auth/sign-in` - Sign in with email/password
  - `/api/mobile-auth/verify` - Verify JWT tokens
- **Status**: Code written, committed, pushed to GitHub
- **Integration**: Uses existing Clerk user data
- **Security**: JWT tokens with 30-day expiration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Blocked

### Vercel Deployment
- **Issue**: React version conflict in monorepo
  - Mobile app uses React 19.1.0 (required by Expo SDK 54)
  - Web app uses React 18.3.0 (required by Next.js 15)
  - npm hoists dependencies at root level, causing conflicts
- **Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentDispatcher')`
- **Impact**: Backend API endpoints not deployed (mobile can't connect)

## üîß What You Need To Do

### Fix Vercel Deployment (5 minutes)

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your `tradie-app-web` project
3. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar
4. Click **General** tab
5. Scroll down to **Root Directory** section
6. Click **Edit** button
7. Enter: `apps/web`
8. Click **Save**
9. Go to **Deployments** tab (top navigation)
10. Click the **‚ãØ menu** on the latest failed deployment
11. Click **Redeploy**

**What this does:**
- Tells Vercel to build only from the `apps/web` directory
- Isolates web app from mobile app's React 19 dependency
- Allows Next.js to use its required React 18

**Expected result:**
- Deployment will succeed
- Backend API endpoints will be live
- Mobile app can authenticate and fetch real data

## üì± After Vercel Deploys

Once the deployment succeeds, your mobile app will be able to:

1. **Authenticate** with production credentials
2. **Fetch real data** from production database
3. **View actual jobs** from your organization
4. **See real clients**
5. **Access calendar** with real appointments

No changes needed to the mobile app - it's already configured with:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://tradie-app-web.vercel.app/api
```

## üìã Next Development Tasks

After authentication is working, the next phase includes:

### Phase 2 Features (from MOBILE_PLAN.md):
- Job detail screens with full information
- Time tracking (start/stop timer)
- Material/equipment entry
- Photo capture and upload
- Job notes
- Status updates
